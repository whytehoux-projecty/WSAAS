## 6. Design Principles to Maintain

While enhancing content, preserve AURUM VAULT's unique identity:

✅ **Keep**: Vintage aesthetic, warm color palette, serif fonts, heritage imagery  
✅ **Avoid**: GTBank's "busy" layout - maintain white space and elegance  
✅ **Balance**: Add utility without sacrificing sophistication  

---

## 7. Key Takeaway

**GTBank optimizes for transactions and compliance** (high-volume retail banking).  
**AURUM VAULT should optimize for trust and relationship-building** (premium personal banking).

The recommendation is to **selectively adopt GTBank's utility features** (login widget, help center, product specificity) while **maintaining our premium, heritage-first brand positioning**.
